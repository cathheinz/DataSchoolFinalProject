# Introduction
Hi, welcome to my Data School Final Project! I joined CSIRO in 2015 leaving Denmark for this great opportunity to work on agriculture in a country with tight link between growers and science and an agricultural sector sustainable without heavy EU subsidies.

Before joining Data School my R experience was adopting colleagues scripts and running them on my own data - once figuring out how to load data from another source. Experiencing even more of the power R has on offer in Data School, I'm now determined to find the time to free myself from excel and the errors that can sneak in when I combine field measurements from different sheets - the errors that are complicated or impossible to back track - and make awesome figures.  


# My Project
In our project team we exploit early vigour to breed weed-competitive wheat and test for proof of concept of the competitivenes. Our data comes from field trials and are phenotype data in the form of scores (1-5), weights or counts. We typically run our trials in several environments, which can be different sites, irrigation regimes or years. We also measure co-factors such as length of plots and weather data. 


Because purposely spreading weeds is no option we use non-wheat crops as weed-surrogates and grow them in mixtures with our developed vigorous wheat lines.  
To experimentally test if the type of weed influence the competitive ability of our vigorous wheats we grew 2 commercial varieties and seven vigorous lines with six different weed-surrogates representing a pamflet of natural occuring weeds.  


## Preliminary results
The used weed-surrogates decreased wheat yield at different strength from measurements of grain yield in our trials in Condobolin 2017 and 2018. 


To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Do you expect that everything will be able 
to be completed within R, or will you need to work with multiple tools to get the right result?
Which of the digital skills needed for your project have you learned since starting Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:
